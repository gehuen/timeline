                    <h4>Significance</h4>
                    <p>This is the start of the salt march and a key part to India's
                        truggle for independence. The salt march would start a chain event 
                        and propel India's goal of freedom from Britian. The salt march 
                        got more people to know about India's struggle for freedom aswell
                        as it motivated more Indians to fight for their country.

                        The march attracts more people along the way, and the group size increases.</p>

                    <h1>4</h1>
                    <p>Gandhi and his followers reach the village of Dandi and break the British salt laws by collecting salt from
                        the beach.</p>

                    <h4>Significance</h4>
                    <p>Breaking the salt law showed that the Indian people were willing to get arrrested to fight for their rights. This was
                        a powerful symbol and would motivate other Indians to fight for their rights. The act of challenging Britian's salt 
                        monopoly symbolized strength and determination to rebel. The action of non-violent protest showed the Indians
                        seeked change to India without resorting to violence.</p>

                    <p>The British authorities arrest Gandhi, along with thousands of other Indian nationalists who have joined the
                        salt march.</p>

                    <h3>Significance</h3>
                    <p>Ghandi's arrest brought international attention to India's fight for freedom. With more eyes on India, the British
                        became nervous of the growing Indian forces. Ghandi was a prominent figure for India, so his arrest further motivated
                        the people of India. The arrest also showed Britian's unwillingness to accept the Indians demands for freedom. </p>

                    <h3>Significance</h3>
                    <p>The signing of this pact showed that the efforts the Indian had a result, as this signified that 
                        the British government was willing to negotiate with Indians. This pact marked the Indian National
                        congress as a legitimate representative of the Indian people. This would provide India more negotiating
                        power and would be a crucial step to India becoming free from Britian.

                        to vote for their own government representative.

                    <h3>Significance</h3>
                    <p>This would cause further divide between the people of India and went against
                        Ghandi's ideology of a united India. He would protest this through fasting. Despite
                        this award giving a voice to the lower classes of India, it was a change that was
                        only positive. This opportunity caused divide between the castes. Despite
                        the mixed reactions to this award, it showed recognition to lower classes
                        and the importance and equality in a political stage.
